PacMen

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohort September 2022. 

The goal of this exercise is to dynamically display pacmen on demand and move the pacmen across the page. I implemented the use of a loop over the pacmen array to move each individual pacman in the DOM. 

How to Run 
1. When you click the "Add PacMan" button a new pacman will appear in a random position on the screen.
2. When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman created will move at a random velocity on the screen.
3. When a pacman hits the edge of the screen it will change position to stay within the frame of the web page. 

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the project
2. Add it to your code editor tool
3. Open index.html

Roadmap 
1. PacMen change direction when they run in to each other or the edge of the screen.
2. PacMen will not populate over the "Add PacMen" or "Start Game" buttons.
